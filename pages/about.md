## Overview
In an effort to further document the town of his hometown of McGill, Keith Gibson has kindly contributed many historical images of the town and the Kennecott Copper Company's mining operation. Further information....

## About the Smelter and Mill Images
In 1975 Keith Gibson's father, Earl Gibson, was General Maintenance Foreman at the mine. Earl was told to take a 5 ft high stack of 8 x 10 Glossy photos to the dump and burn them. He took them home and hid them in the family's basement and Keith found them after his father passed. Most of them were facial photos of workers which were given to surviving relatives. Keith saved the rest and eventually digitized them into the image files you see on this site. These images form the backbone of the history of the copper companies.
